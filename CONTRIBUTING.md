Git-audit prefers not to maintain its own style guide, but it enforce the style and best practices established by the Go project and its community. This means contributors should:
* Follow the guidelines [Uber's go coding guidelines](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md)
* Follow the guidelines set out by the [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) document.
* Preempt common Go [code review comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) and [test review comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TestComments)
